\section{Datasets}
\label{datasets}

How did you gather the data? Did you digitise it? How? Is the material
publicly available? What tools did you use 1) to handle (store,
manipulate) the data and 2) to compute measures on the data?

\subsection{London Gang Network Dataset}
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the \textbf{London Gang Network}. The data was gathered from a public academic repository widely used for social network analysis, hosted by the UCINET Software project.

The material is publicly available and was accessed from the following URL: \footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/covert-networks/london-gang}}.

\subsubsection{Digitisation and Data Handling}

The dataset was already available in a digital format; no manual digitization was required. For the purpose of this study, the data was formatted as a CSV file (\texttt{LONDON\_GANG.csv}), representing the adjacency matrix of the network (comprising 54 nodes).
A corresponding attribute file, \texttt{LONDON\_GANG\_ATTR.csv}, provides node-level data for each member. These attributes include \texttt{Age}, \texttt{Birthplace}, \texttt{Residence}, \texttt{Arrests}, \texttt{Convictions}, \texttt{Prison}, \texttt{Music}, and \texttt{Ranking}. For the purpose of this study, only the \textbf{Birthplace} attribute was utilized. This decision was based on it being the sole common attribute available for both the London network and the Italian network.
For \textbf{1) handling and manipulating} the data, the \textbf{Python} programming language was used, specifically the \textbf{\texttt{pandas}} library. The \texttt{pandas.read\_csv} function was employed to load the adjacency matrix into a DataFrame structure.

\subsubsection{Computing Measures}

For \textbf{2) computing measures} on the data, the Python library \textbf{\texttt{NetworkX}} was used.

The \texttt{pandas} DataFrame (containing the adjacency matrix) was converted into a \texttt{NetworkX} graph object using the \texttt{nx.from\_pandas\_adjacency} function. This graph object then served as the foundation for computing all measures.
