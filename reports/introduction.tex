\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
The present study is situated within the social sciences, focusing on the use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) to examine covert criminal organizations. Our application involves a comparative analysis of two covert criminal networks (one in Italy and one in London) to highlight structural and sociocultural differences. The datasets used, the Italian Gangs Network (67 nodes, 114 edges)  (available online at \cite{italianGangsSite}) and the London Gang Network (54 nodes, 315 edges) (available online at \cite{londonGangSite}), map internal relationships and include a shared metadata attribute: each individual’s nationality.
