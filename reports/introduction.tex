\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
The present study is situated within the field of social sciences, focusing on the use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) to examine covert criminal organizations. In this work, we carry out a comparative analysis of two covert criminal networks (one in Italy and one in London) to highlight their structural and sociocultural differences. The datasets used for this study, the Italian Gang Network (67 nodes, 114 edges)  (available online at \cite{italianGangsSite}) and the London Gang Network (54 nodes, 315 edges) (available online at \cite{londonGangSite}), map internal relationships and include a shared metadata attribute: the nationality of each individual.
